This demo is using NLSSR algorithm to HSI denoising.

When you use this demo, you can directly run the function "NLSSR_Denoising_Demo.m".

Currenly, this demo can be effectively used to test three datasets, including the CAVE dataset,
the PAC dataset, and the WDC dataset.

If you are testing other dataset and cannot obtain effective denoising results, 
please adjust the parameter function "Opts_Set.m" with the parameter "Opts.c1".

If you have any question, please connect Dr. Zha Zhiyuan. Email: zhiyuan.zha@ntu.edu.sg.
